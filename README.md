# Youtube_DataHarvesting_and_Warehousing_Using_SQL and Streamlit
This is my first python project to harvest and utilizing the YouTube Data API, gather data from YouTube and store it in a MongoDB NoSQL database.Following that, the data is transferred as tables from the NoSQL database to the SQL database and shown in the streamlit application.

Introduction:
         The goal of the YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project is to give consumers access to and analysis of data from several YouTube channels. The project uses Streamlit, SQL, and MongoDB to create an intuitive application that lets users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube channel and video data.

Data Collection:
        Gathering information from YouTube is the first stage. The YouTube Data API can be used for this. Numerous types of data are accessible through the API, such as analytics related to audience engagement, video statistics, and channel metadata.

Data Storage:
        There are several methods for storing the gathered data. We will be using SQL and MongoDB in this project. Large volumes of unstructured data are ideally suited for storage in NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Structured data analysis and querying are ideally suited for relational databases like SQL.

Data Warehousing:
         A data warehouse, which is a centralized repository for data, is one place the data may be kept. Large volumes of data from numerous sources are kept in data warehouses. They are useful for data analysis, trend identification, and prediction.

Data Analysis:
         Many tools can be used to analyze the data. For this project, Streamlit will be utilized. An interactive web application can be made with the Python package Streamlit. To build a dashboard that enables users to view and examine the data, we'll utilize Streamlit.

Libraries Used:
         Python
         Google Api Client
         MongoDB
         PostgreSQL
         Streamlit

Features:
    The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing program has the following features: using the YouTube API to retrieve channel and video data from YouTube.
           The NoSQL database MongoDB is used for data storage.
           Data transfer from the data lake to a SQL database so that analysis and querying may be done quickly.
           Data is searched for and retrieved from the SQL database using various search parameters.

Conclusion:
        This project has shown how to utilize Streamlit, MongoDB, and SQL to gather and store YouTube data. Data from a range of sources can be gathered, stored, and analyzed using this method.
